Express TypeScript Starter

A simple starter project for building an Express.js application with TypeScript.
This repo demonstrates how to set up a basic server with Express using TypeScript, providing type safety and a clean developer workflow.

🚀 Features

Express server setup with TypeScript

Strongly typed request/response handling

Easy to extend for APIs or backend services

Development with hot-reload support (using tools like Nodemon & ts-node)

❓ Why TypeScript with Express?

While Express works perfectly with JavaScript, combining it with TypeScript brings several benefits:

Type Safety → Catch errors during development instead of runtime.

Better Autocomplete → Your editor provides intelligent suggestions for Express objects like Request and Response.

Scalability → Easier to maintain large applications with well-defined types and interfaces.

Cleaner Code → Improved readability and fewer runtime bugs.

This makes TypeScript a solid choice when building production-ready APIs and backend services.
